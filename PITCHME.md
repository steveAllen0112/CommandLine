# The Command Line IS:

## User Interface

+++

Just like your mouse, your touchpad, your touchscreen, and even like punch cards, the Command Line is a User Interface for your computer.

+++

It's a way of telling a computer what to do.

+++

(It used to be the ONLY way, for screen-based systems.  Punch cards will not be discussed.)

# Applications

+++

## Windows

 - CMD.exe, aka "Command Prompt"
 - PuTTy

---

# Why should I care?

+++

## Simplicity

 - Portable
 - Scriptable (Bash, etc.)
 - Shareable

+++

## Speed

 - Rapid Access
 - Copy/paste commands
 - Composable (can tell system to use results of one command as input for next)
 
+++

## Precision

 - Easily set many settings/configuration preferences for the command to be aware of at runtime
 - One less layer of abstraction from a GUI

+++

## Access
